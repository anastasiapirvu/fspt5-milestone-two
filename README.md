# Full Stack Development Test - Week Two

This assessment tests your understanding of classes, testing, HOFs and list-type data structures.

## Guidelines

- The resources you may use online are:
  - [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  - [Chai docs](https://www.chaijs.com/api/)
- Make sure you give yourself a grade before turning it in!

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem.
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Steps to run the test

```bash
yarn
yarn test
```

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade | Explanation                                                        |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   4   | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3   | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2   | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer.                  |
|   1   | I am struggling with this question.                                |
|   0   | I did not attempt this question (explain why)                      |

### 1. Create and extend classes

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: I think I understand the basics of creating parent and child classes, although I couldn't think of more clomplex methods.

### 2. Create tests for classes

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: I think I understand the logic behind running the tests, but my tests were primitive and not very well designed, probably the reason why they all passed.

### 3. Use HOFs from the Array prototype

- Grade: 1
- Explanation: HoFs is probably the topic I struggle most with - I tried solving the first part before running out of time - I commented out the code on this one since the terminal would give me an error.

### 4. Create the reverse linked list method

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: Thank you for the pseudo code! It really helped to break down the solution and write step by step lines of code, I think I was quite close in terms of doing all the steps to reverse the list, but couldn't pass the tests.
